### Hi
This repo is the collection of example story that demonstrating what I can do to storybook.
I only choose the most common practices I used every daily dev.

### What I can do to storybook

1. Developing a component
2. Developing an extracted component with connected Redux
    * Eg. I can take a partial of my redux application put it to story
3. Developing a component that request API and no need **waiting** data return API
    * I can even test how my component corresponding to not-existed-yet API
4. Running the storybook by jest to check if my teammate updates make the stories errors
